# Examining impact of veterinary connections within drug repurposing knowledge graphs

### Description
This project provides a reproducible starting point to build a knowledge graph (KG) that integrates veterinary drug resources and to evaluate the effect of adding veterinary data to drug-repurposing KG completion experiments.

### Project Structure
knowledge_graphs: scripts related to construction/integration of vet-informed knowledge graph

evaluation: comparing knowledge graph performance with graph neural network

addl_resources: Git Submodules pointing to additional references that are foundational 

### Quick start
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
